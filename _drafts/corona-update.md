Checking our churn channel more often than what is rational. Running a SMB with revenue based on SMBs in our market is making me nervous.

Running a small business is hard enough, but at least itâ€™s all on ourselves. We can always treat our customers better, improve our product and find more sales channels. All we can do now is wait to see how bad it will get.
