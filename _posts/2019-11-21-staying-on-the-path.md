[This post](https://m.signalvnoise.com/enough/) really resonated with me. Especially this:

> Thereâ€™s a long parade of companies that placed growth above all else, got big, then never got to actually extract any profits because the market disappeared or self-inflicted wounds took them down.

> Taking profits every year, along the way, insulates owners from ending up as the last, biggest fool to buy a stake before the valuation stops growing.

We're often confronted with growth discussions. Either from outside the company or inside.

Often I hit my self in the head with this question:

> Are we growing fast enough?

Reading DHH's post gives me confidence in the fact that we are growing organically. 

There is a path forward where we grow slow and steady. Right now I just want to stay on that path.
